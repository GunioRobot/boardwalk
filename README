NOTE: Rack doesn't play nice with thin or webrick while running boardwalk. So 
			until the issue is fixed, you will need to edit the following line in
			rack/request.rb on your local machine (if you're having issues):
			
			def media_type
	      content_type && content_type.split(/\s*[;,]\s*/, 2).first.downcase
	    end
	
			to..
			
			def media_type
	      content_type && content_type.split(/\s*[;,]\s*/, 2).first#.downcase
	    end
	
			This should fix everything.
